The aim of the project is to create a portable device that can be used to meet the water requirements of a regular household. This device will condense the water present in the atmosphere and then filter it so that it can be used for drinking. It is a device that extracts water from humid ambient air by cooling the air below the dew point temperature. This device is useful in locations where humidity is more and scarcity of drinking of water. Major Components include - Compressor, Evaporator, Condenser, Pump, Refrigerant.
