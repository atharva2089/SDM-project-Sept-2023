## DRY Principles

- DRY, which stands for ‘Don’t Repeat Yourself,’ is a principle of software development that means reducing the repetition of patterns and code duplication.
- It follows of abstractions and avoiding redundancy.
- The way to achieve DRY is by creating functions and classes to make sure that any logic should be written in only one place.
- Duplication of code can make code very difficult to maintain. Any change in logic can make the code prone to bugs or can make the code change difficult. This can be fixed by 
  doing code reuse.
- DRY is a goal of removing logic duplication.
