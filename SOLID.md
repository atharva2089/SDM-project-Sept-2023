## SOLID Principle
### - S ( Single Responsibility Principle ) :

- The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer programming principle that states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."


### - O ( Open-Closed Principle ) :

- In object-oriented programming, the openâ€“closed principle (OCP) states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification", that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.

### - L ( Liskov Substitution Principle ) :

-Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. In other words, what we want is to have the objects of our subclasses behaving the same way as the objects of our superclass.

### - I (Interface Segregation Principle ) :

- the interface segregation principle (ISP) states that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

### - D ( Dependency Inversion Principle ) :

- The dependency inversion principle states that high-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than low-level modules. This helps to decouple the components in your application and can make your code more flexible, maintainable, and easier to test.
